<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This document describes the third major iteration of the OpenADR
protocol. It serves as a near functional equivalent of its predecessor,
OpenADR 2.0b, but departs from the 2.0b SOAP-like web service design and
instead adheres to RESTful web service best practices. REST services are
much more common today than SOAP and are generally considered much more
straightforward to use and troubleshoot. The main goal in providing this
version as a complement to 2.0b is to lower the barriers of entry for
new implementers and thereby encourage more widespread adoption of the
standard.</p>
<p>[This document contains normative and non-normative content and may
contain simplifications for the purpose of conveying the underlying
OpenADR REST concepts. Additional normative content can be found in the
Normative References section, including the OpenADR 3.0 OpenAPI
document.]{.mark} [OADR-3.0-Specification] which is the authoritative
specification of the interface between VTN and clients.</p>
<h2 id="revision-3.0.2-introduction" class="unnumbered">1.1 Revision 3.0.2 Introduction</h2>
<p>The 3.0 revision supported a single mechanism (webhooks, via HTTP) for
the Virtual Top Node (VTN) to push notifications to clients (resulting
from Subscriptions), this revision adds support for notification event
delivery via standard messaging protocols, with MQTT being the first
such messaging protocol defined.</p>

<h1>Terms and Definitions</h1>
<p>OpenADR 3.0 adopts many terms from 2.0b directly, such as Event and
Report. Terms that are new or modified are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Program -</strong> The business context for a given usage of the VTN. May be a Demand Response program, tariff, or other business construct.</li>
<li><strong>ProgramName</strong> - A unique name for a program or tariff. May be used by customers.</li>
<li><strong>[Program Description]{.mark} -</strong> A human readable document provided out-of-band by a Business Logic entity that specifies a usage of the OpenADR 3.0 object model and configuration details such as VTN address, program names, applicable customer types, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Tariff -</strong> A type of program that defines the basic agreement between a retailer and a customer, such as an electricity pricing structure, as opposed to optional programs offered on top of a tariff.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Top Node (VTN) -</strong> An application that implements the OpenADR 3.0 APIs. This is a Resource Server in REST parlance.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual End Node (VEN)</strong> - A software application that consumes events, generates reports, and directly or indirectly causes changes in energy consumption patterns. This is a client of a VTN.</li>
<li><strong>Business Logic (BL)</strong> - Application logic embodied in one or more software applications deployed by a utility, retailer, or other &apos;program owner&apos; of the VTN that typically produces events and consumes reports. It may be incorporated into the VTN resource server such that the business logic application exposes the OpenADR 3.0 API. We use the term here to refer to a client of a VTN.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Logic (CL)</strong> - Application logic that requests and responds to program and event objects, produces reports, and may provide human facing features to support configuration and monitoring. May be incorporated into or interface with a VEN client.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="messaging-protocol-terms-and-definitions" class="unnumbered">4.1 Messaging Protocol Terms and Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broker</strong> - The standard term for the &quot;server&quot; component of a messaging protocol system. VTNs implementing an additional messaging protocol would include at least one messaging broker.</li>
<li><strong>Topic</strong> - A category used to organize messages. Each topic has a name that is unique to the broker.</li>
<li><strong>Client</strong> - A client connects to a broker, in order to write or read messages.</li>
<li><strong>Publisher/Producer</strong> - A client that writes messages to a topic on a broker.VTNs implementing this proposal would be publishing clients</li>
<li><strong>Subscriber/Consumer</strong> - A client that reads messages from a topic on a broker. Typically the subscribing client will subscribe to a topic, and subsequently receive (read) messages published to that topic. VENs implementing this proposal would be subscribing clients.</li>
<li><strong>Binding</strong> - A specification (and implementation) of a specific messaging protocol technology to the OpenADR 3.0.2 Messaging Protocol endpoints/extensions. This revision specifies the binding to the MQTT protocol. Future revisions may specify additional bindings, one potential future binding may be to Kafka.</li>
<li><strong>Subscribe-able Object</strong> - An OpenADR 3 object that can be subscribed to, resulting in subsequent notifications of changes to the subscribed object are sent to the subscriber. OpenADR 3 subscribe-able objects include: PROGRAM, EVENT, REPORT, SUBSCRIPTION, VEN, and RESOURCE.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<h2>System Architecture</h2>
<p>REST systems are composed of a Resource Server exposing a set of HTTP
APIs and multiple clients of the API. An OpenADR 3.0 VTN is a Resource
Server, and like an OpenADR 2.0b VTN it provides a mechanism for
business logic of a utility or other entity to transmit events and
receive reports to and from an energy consuming client, known as a VEN.</p>
<p>OpenADR 3.0 defines a RESTful interface that is used by both business
logic clients and customer logic clients, aka VENs, which represent
flexible loads and other customer devices. In this model, an OpenADR 3.0
Resource Server (VTN) provides a mechanism for business logic and energy
consumers to exchange events and reports. Figure 1 illustrates the
canonical REST paradigm of server and clients, and how OpenADR terms are
applied to these constructs.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1. REST and its application to OpenADR</strong></p>
<p>Business Logic (BL) is application software hosted by an energy retailer
that integrates to the retailers backend systems and interfaces with a
VTN. It may also support an onboarding process, including a User
Interface, by which VENs are provided security credentials and other
configuration information (e.g. VTN URL).</p>
<p>Customer Logic (CL) uses a VEN client to obtain demand response events
produced by BL and subsequently manage a set of &apos;resources&apos; such as
flexible loads and customer devices. CL may expose a User Interface to
facilitate configuration and management of the VEN, e.g. configure VTN
address.</p>
<p>An implementation of an OpenADR 3.0 system might incorporate Business
Logic (BL) into a VTN, such that certain API features are not used by
the BL and instead implementation specific mechanisms are used to
support BL functions.</p>
<p>OpenADR 3.0.2 VTNs supporting notifications via messaging protocols will
include one (or more) messaging brokers. VTN clients will make (newly
defined) REST requests to the VTN to determine the VTN&apos;s support for
messaging protocol bindings, and if supported, details of message broker
connection information, and the topic names available for subscribable
object notifications. A VTN will include a broker for each supported
messaging protocol, if any. The relationships between the VTN&apos;s REST and
message protocol broker, and potential clients are shown in Figure 1.5</p>
<p><img src="media/image4.png" alt>{width=&quot;3.463542213473316in&quot;
height=&quot;4.299569116360455in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1.5</strong></p>
<p>A tiered hierarchy of VTNs and VENs may also be supported, in which an
entity acts as a VEN to interact with a VTN, and then presents its own
VTN to &apos;downstream&apos; VENs. This is shown in Figure 2.</p>
<p><img src="media/image3.png" alt="image1.png">{width=&quot;4.998214129483815in&quot;
height=&quot;2.8125in&quot;}</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2. OpenADR 3.0 example implementation scenarios</strong></p>
<h2>Local Scenarios</h2>
<p>A common expected future usage of OpenADR will be for a central device
in a building to receive OpenADR events as a VEN, then rebroadcast
these - possibly modified - to local flexible loads and other devices.
The term &apos;local&apos; is applied to match IT usage as with a Local Area
Network; this is distinct from &apos;locational&apos; to refer to a geographic
region, as with locational retail prices. The central device might be a
large building energy management system, a central hub for a collection
of local devices (e.g. for the Matter protocol), a microgrid controller,
or even just a Wi-Fi access point. The device is then a VTN for the
local devices. This is an example of the use of a hierarchy of OpenADR
links as in the right side of Figure 2.</p>
<p>There are several cases in which centralizing the reception of retail
prices is beneficial. Only one device needs to be aware of the identity
of the retailer and tariff, so that if these change only one device
needs to be updated. Another case is when the customer wishes to
incorporate the burden of greenhouse gas emissions into the optimization
of loads and other devices, and do so with a &apos;local price&apos;; the GHG
value is multiplied by a &#x24;/ton burden value and added to the retail
price. The localPrice boolean in a program description notifies
downstream devices that the retail price has been modified. Another use
of a central device is to receive OpenADR signals over multiple
communication channels for redundancy. Yet another is for microgrid
operation when the grid is down - the central device can be a microgrid
controller and use OpenADR events, e.g. prices, to balance supply and
demand.</p>
<p>It is not anticipated that the OpenADR standard needs to be modified in
any way to fully support local operation, but any changes would be
supplementary capabilities.</p>
<h2>VEN enrollment</h2>
<p>OpenADR relies on an out-of-band process by which Business Logic (BL)
entities (e.g. utilities) and VENs/Customer Logic agree on the specifics
of a &apos;program&apos; or &apos;tariff&apos;. A &apos;program description&apos; may be provided by
the BL entity that specifies event structure, reporting requirements,
and other details of a program or tariff. In general, VENs must enroll
with a BL entity to receive security credentials. These credentials are
used by a VTN to Authenticate and Authorize VEN requests. A VEN on a
tariff and some programs may not need to be authenticated to the VTN.</p>
<p>A BL entity provides a web flow or other mechanism to onboard VENs into
(non-tariff) programs. This commonly involves action by the Customer. A
VTN may choose to make some programs freely available, such as those
that are for a tariff and, for example, only distribute prices and
similar information.</p>
<p>Every electric utility customer is on a tariff. This is often a default
or assigned by the utility based on customer characteristics. This
assignment or selection of a tariff is the out-of-band process for a
customer that will then want to receive the prices for that tariff.
Tariffs also have a program description as other demand response
coordination mechanisms have, though it is usually simpler.</p>
<h1>General Usage</h1>
<h2>VTN provided fields</h2>
<p>On object creation of programs, events, reports, subscriptions, vens,
and ven resources, client representations provided to the VTN on POST
requests are incomplete, as clients do not have the context to provide
accurate or meaningful values for the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>objectID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>createdDataTime</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>modificationDateTime</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>objectType</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A VTN SHALL populate object representations with the above fields on
object creation.</p>
<h2>Required and optional properties</h2>
<p>The specification is purposefully sparse of required fields so that
clients may create and modify objects by creating requests with minimal
effort.</p>
<p>If a representation sent to the VTN lacks a required property, a VTN
SHALL return a 400, Bad Request response. A resource is not created or
updated. Required fields do not have default values.</p>
<p>A representation provided in a write request (PUT, POST) to the VTN may
exclude optional fields. The VTN may create a corresponding object with
such excluded fields set to default values.</p>
<p>A VTN may provide representations of an object that do not include
optional properties that have their default value.</p>
<p>Optional fields are generally nullable and have default values of null,
where no assumption can be made on what reasonable a default value might
be.</p>
<p>If a representation includes a property that is not defined by an
object&apos;s schema, a VTN may create a corresponding resource without the
additional property, effectively ignoring the additional content.</p>
<h2>Response Codes and Errors</h2>
<p>A VTN SHALL support the following standard codes:</p>
<p>GET</p>
<p>200 - OK</p>
<p>400 - Bad Request</p>
<p>403 - Forbidden</p>
<p>404 - Not Found</p>
<p>500 - Internal Server Error</p>
<p>POST</p>
<p>201 - Created</p>
<p>400 - Bad Request</p>
<p>403 - Forbidden</p>
<p>404 - Not Found</p>
<p>409 - Conflict (item already exists)</p>
<p>500 - Internal Server Error</p>
<p>PUT</p>
<p>200 - OK</p>
<p>400 - Bad Request</p>
<p>403 - Forbidden</p>
<p>404 - Not Found</p>
<p>409 - Conflict</p>
<p>500 - Internal Server Error</p>
<p>DELETE</p>
<p>200 - OK</p>
<p>400 - Bad Request</p>
<p>403 - Forbidden</p>
<p>404 - Not Found</p>
<p>500 - Internal Server Error</p>
<p>Servers may implement other response codes, but VENs might not recognize
them.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>On 40x and 500 responses, a VTN SHALL respond with a <em>problem</em> object
that contains details of the error. The problem object is intended to
help clients determine what caused a particular response, such as Bad
Request, Unauthorized, Forbidden, etc.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>problem</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-json"><span class="hljs-punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">&quot;title&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Not Found&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>

<span class="hljs-punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Figure 3. Problem Example</strong></p>
<h2>POST and PUT</h2>
<p>POST is used to create new objects, and PUT is used to update an
existing object. A VTN SHALL ignore objectID, createdDateTime,
modificationDateTime, and objectType values included in representations
used in POST and PUT requests.</p>
<h2>Compression</h2>
<p>In some circumstances the size of responses should be minimized, such as
over bandwidth-constrained connections.</p>
<p>The HTTP protocol allows a client to request encoding using one of
several compression algorithms, such as GZIP, by using the
Accept-Encoding header. Server responses can then use the
Content-Encoding header to indicate the algorithm chosen, and the
response body is compressed accordingly. The result should be a seamless
exchange where data is compressed.</p>
<p>Configuring this behavior is outside the scope of the OpenAPI definition
of the OpenADR protocol. Instead, compression is implemented through
configuration of the HTTP/REST framework used for OpenADR clients and
servers.</p>
<p>Support for a given compression format is optional for VTNs, although
gzip is encouraged.</p>
<h2>Support for Strongly Typed languages</h2>
<p>Certain OpenAPI construct, such as oneOf and anyOf are not suited to
code-generation of client or server stubs in strongly typed languages
like Java and C#. Code generators could operate if such constructs
explicitly included a super class with the alternative schemas modeled
as subclasses, but this is not implemented in OpenADR 3.0. Where OpenADR
3.0. uses oneOf and anyOf , classes should be manually created in some
languages.</p>
<h2>Message validation</h2>
<p>A VTN SHALL reject request bodies that do not contain required fields.
Content that is not described by a message schema MAY be ignored. (See
Section 9.1 Model Extension). Validation of content by a VTN content is
outside the scope of this specification and is considered an
implementation detail.</p>
<p>Content validation is the responsibility of clients and therefore
outside the scope of this specification.</p>
<h2>Subscriptions</h2>
<p>OpenADR 3.0 supports both pull and push interactions. Pull interactions
are initiated by a client and are implemented with HTTP GET, POST, PUT,
and DELETE.</p>
<p>Push interactions are implemented with Subscriptions via webhooks. These
allow a client to be notified when certain operations transpire. A
webhook is a client endpoint registered with the VTN. When a specified
operation occurs, for example when an event is created, a request to the
client endpoint may be made by the VTN, thus notifying the client of the
new event.</p>
<p>Webhooks are implemented using subscription objects. A client creates a
new subscription object, which contains the webhook callback URL, and a
description of the objects and operations that will trigger a request to
the callback URL.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 7. GET / brokers Example</strong></p>
<p>The client may then connect to the VTN&apos;s message broker, and request

endpoints:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The response from the VTN is a JSON object, containing the following
keys:</p>
<ul>
<li>request - A copy of the request URL path, with no leading &quot;/&quot;</li>
<li>topics - A JSON object, each key being the operation on the object, and the value of that key is the topic-name for that operation</li>
<li>binding - Always &quot;mqtt&quot; for MQTT topic names</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike the Subscriptions REST request, response filtering (see section
6.9 below) is not supported for topic subscriptions made via messaging
protocols. If a client subscribes to an object&apos;s operations, it will
receive all such notifications, and it is the responsibility of the
client to ignore/filter events to which it is not interested.</p>
<p>The format and content of the notification messages received by clients
will be the same as the existing notification JSON response format
specified in OpenADR 3.0 (which is also the same as what is returned
when the message is obtained via an OpenADR 3.0 REST GET request).</p>
<h2>Response Filtering</h2>
<p>A VTN may support large numbers of objects, such as vens and associated
resources. In order to reduce potentially large responses that might
include object representations of no interest to a client, clients may
provide query params to allow a VTN to filter results.</p>
<p>For example, when requesting a list of reports, a client may specify,
through query params, that only reports associated with a specific
program, and/or created by a specific client, be included in a response.</p>
<p>Targeting criteria can be used to filter responses to include only those
objects that are targeted to specific vens and resources.</p>
<p>Program, event, and subscription objects may contain lists of targets
which indicate sets of vens and resources that are the intended
recipients of these objects. Vens and resources may include their own
targeting criteria to expose their target attributes.</p>
<p>Filtering query params are applied to the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>GET &lt;&gt;/programs: targets</code></li>
<li><code>GET &lt;&gt;/reports: programID, clientName</code></li>
<li><code>GET &lt;&gt;/events: programID, targets</code></li>
<li><code>GET &lt;&gt;/subscriptions: programID, clientName, targets</code></li>
<li><code>GET &lt;&gt;/vens: targets</code></li>
<li><code>GET &lt;&gt;/vens/{venID}/resources: targets</code></li>
</ul>
<p>VTN SHALL support limit and skip query params on GET operations, as
described by [OADR-3.0-Specification], to control pagination of
potentially large responses.</p>
<p>VTN SHALL treat filtering params as additive, that is, results must
match every filter term.</p>
<p>Future versions of OpenADR3 may provide other features that facilitate
massive scalability or operation under extremely bandwidth or memory
constrained environments.</p>
<h2>Object names</h2>
<p>Some objects have name attributes that can be used as query parameters
to retrieve them. This requires uniqueness with given scopes.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>program.progranName</code> - must be unique to a VTN instance.</li>
<li><code>ven.venName</code> - must be unique within the scope of a VTN instance.</li>
<li><code>ven.resource.resourceName</code> - must be unique to its associated ven.</li>
</ul>
<p>event and report names are not required to be unique.</p>
<h1>Information Model</h1>
<p>An Information Model is a conceptual representation of entities and
relationships to facilitate human communication; to be useful for
machines it is translated to a data model. [OADR-3.0-Specification] is
a machine-readable YAML file providing the authoritative description of
the protocol, including schema components that define a concrete
representation of the Information Model. While the YAML is
human-readable, the description here is provided as an easier to digest
summary of the main data objects defined in the Specification.</p>
<p>The specification document does not describe all aspects of the meaning
of the data elements below. Considerable detail on this is in the User
Guide [OADR-3.0-User_Guide]. Examples of detail found there are for
payload descriptors, events, reports, interval timing, data quality, and
targeting.</p>
<p>IDs for programs, events, and reports are created by the VTN when these
objects are posted, and all such IDs are unique within the VTN. Other
identifiers are created out-of-band of OpenADR such as clientID in
report or created by the entity creating the object such as ID in
interval.</p>
<p>Objects that are addressable through the API, i.e. can be accessed via
<code>&lt;url&gt;/path/{objectID}</code>, contain an ID attribute that is of type
objectID, and creation and modification timestamps. These attributes are
populated by the VTN on object creation and modification.</p>
<p>In the listing below, any default value is listed in brackets after the
definition.</p>

<h1>EndPoints</h1>
<p>A REST API provides URLs that clients use to perform CRUD operations on
&apos;resources&apos;; this is a URL path but usually called an &apos;endpoint&apos;. Object
instances of the items described by the Information Model above are
&apos;resources&apos;, and CRUD operations are Create, Read, Update, and Destroy,
implemented by the HTTP verbs POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE. There is
copious free information on the web regarding REST APIs. One good
example for background is [REST_Best_Practice].</p>
<p>The YAML document [OADR-3.0-Specification] provides the authoritative
and complete definition of the endpoint&#x200b;&#x200b; and operations supported by the
profile. For programs and events, only the BL will do POST, PUT, and
DELETE operations. Only VENs will POST and PUT reports and
subscriptions.</p>
<p>POST is used to create new objects, and PUT is used to update an
existing object. objectID and createdDateTime values included in
representations used in POST and PUT requests will be ignored by the VTN
server.</p>
<p>The text below is a heavily subsetted version of the specification that
summarizes only the essential information for human readability. The
term &apos;security&apos; below indicates the scopes necessary to perform the
associated operation. Scopes are discussed elsewhere.</p>
<p>The security terms below (e.g. &quot;security: [read_all]&quot;) indicate the
access permissions required to perform an operation. From the
specification:</p>

<h1>Revision</h1>
<p>REST APIs may be designed to be revised and preserve backwards
compatibility. Typically, the base URL will contain a version number,
e.g. <code>https://myAPI/1.0/</code>, with 1.0
as a version number. A revision to the API can be given a new version
number and hosted at a new base URL, e.g
<code>https://myAPI/1.1/</code>. A VTN could offer both versions concurrently, allowing older clients to interoperate
with the older version while upgrading to the new version at a time of
their choosing. Typically, an older version will be deprecated after
some period of time. While there is currently no plan to revise OpenADR
3.0, doing so with this mechanism would be easy to implement.</p>
<p>Versioning will follow Semantic Versioning [SEMVER] guidelines where a
version number is of the form major.minor.patch and each may be
incremented as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes</li>
<li>MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner</li>
<li>PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes</li>
</ol>
<h1>Extensibility</h1>
<p>The OpenADR 3.0 protocol allows servers and clients to interoperate
without custom integration. It is intended to provide a functional
footprint that is sufficient to accommodate all common demand response
use cases. However, some demand response program developers may find it
useful to use content that cannot be expressed using the constructs of
the specification, or could be expressed in a better form with an
extension.</p>
<p>There are two extension mechanisms offered by OpenADR 3.0: model
extensions, and private strings.</p>
<h2>Model Extension</h2>
<p>A VTN and clients might agree to private model extensions by adding
constructs to the standard models. VTNs that are ignorant of such
private extensions may simply ignore such content and underlying
functionality that represents such private extensions.</p>
<p>The example in Figure 3 shows an event object with a non-standardized
attribute called myPrivateObject. This attribute may be ignored by VTNs
that do not recognize it.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-json"><span class="hljs-punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">&quot;ID&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">&quot;createdDateTime&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;2023-06-15T09:12:28.000Z&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">&quot;modificationDateTime&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;0000-00-00&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">&quot;myPrivateObject&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;whatever I want&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>
  \....\
<span class="hljs-punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Figure 7. Example Event object</strong></p>
<h2>Private Strings</h2>
<p>The standard provides enumerated values for a number of object fields.
These enumerations have defined semantics. A VTN and clients may agree
on additional values that can be supplied in these fields.</p>
<p>The example below shows a report payload object with the
non-standardized string PRIVATE_ALGORITHM. VTNs do not process attribute
values, so the use of non-standard strings does not affect the behavior
of the VTN but both Business Logic and VEN clients may process their
agreed upon strings.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-json"><span class="hljs-attr">&quot;payloads&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span>
<span class="hljs-punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">&quot;type&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;PRIVATE_ALGORITHM&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">&quot;values&quot;</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-number">0.17</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span>
<span class="hljs-punctuation">}</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Figure 8. Example Private String</strong></p>
<h1>Enumerations</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A critical feature of OpenADR is the use of enumerations that provide
context to payload values. For example, a payload value of &apos;0.17&apos; is
associated with context in order for a client to know that it is a
price, or percent, or other type of data. OpenADR 3.0 uses enumerated
strings to provide context to data. These strings enable BL and VENs to
interoperate. Note that payload values are always an array and so
enclosed in brackets (&quot;[...]&quot;) even if just a single value.</p>
<p>VENs that support standard enumerations should interoperate with BL that
generates events with those values, and conversely generate reports that
can be consumed by BL that support them. A program may define its own
strings and work with VEN partners as they implement the appropriate
logic (see Private Extensions in [OADR-3.0-User_Guide]).</p>
<p>OpenADR 3.0 defines enumerations for those use cases that are well
described, are in use today, and/or are plausible for use in the near
future. Notes in definitions are not part of the formal definition but
include useful information and context.</p>
<p>The term &quot;enumeration&quot; is used in its common form as simply indicating
lists, and not in the computer science sense of mapping numbers to
names. There is no utility in OpenADR to assign numeric values to the
strings defined here as enumerations.</p>
<h2>Event Payload Enumerations</h2>
<p>The following defined names and types inform a VEN on how to interpret
values in an event interval payload. The enumerations may be assigned to
the payloadType attribute of a payload included in an interval included
in an event and in an associated payloadDescriptor in the Event or
Program. For example:</p>

qualifier is absent. Note that these apply to the data source in
general, not to specific intervals.</p>
<p>Reading types are used in payloadDescriptor objects to provide context
to associated payloads. For example:</p>

<p>DIRECT_READ      Payload values have been determined by direct
measurement from a resource.</p>
<p>ESTIMATED        Payload value is an estimate where no Direct Read was
available for the interval, but sufficient other data
exist to make a reasonable estimate.</p>
<p>SUMMED           Payload value is the sum of multiple data sources.</p>
<p>MEAN             Payload value represents the mean measurements over an
interval.</p>
<p>PEAK             Payload value represents the highest measurement over
an interval.</p>
<p>FORECAST         Payload value is a forecast of future values, not a
measurement or estimate of actual data.</p>
<p>AVERAGE          Payload value represents the average of measurements
over an interval.</p>

<h1>Security</h1>
<p>Security in OpenADR addresses the Authentication and Authorization of
client requests to the VTN server. Common REST API best practices are
followed, and the Oauth2 client credential flow describes the mechanism
to secure the API.</p>
<h2>Security objectives</h2>
<p>The overall approach to security in OpenADR 3.0 is based on the
following three pillars.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication.</strong> A client request is Authenticated with a VTN in order to access resources[^1]. REST servers are &apos;stateless&apos; and do not maintain session state, therefore every API request must contain some token or credential to allow the VTN server to authenticate the identity of the requestor.</li>
<li><strong>Authorization.</strong> Within the context of a given program, a VEN will be authorized to access some set of resources and associated operations. The VTN server will limit access to resources and associated operations to those authorized to a requestor, based on the identity of the requestor. See Authentication above.</li>
<li><strong>Common (well known and widely implemented) Security Model</strong>. OADR REST adopts common industry approaches to Authentication and Authorization. [REST-API-Best_Practices]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<p>The following specific assumptions underlie the OpenADR 3.0 security
model.</p>
<ul>
<li>VTN security must meet stringent requirements. Client requests must be able to be authenticated and access to API resources and operations must be able to be authorized.
<ul>
<li>VTNs are software applications that do not directly interface with any element of the grid. As an information service provided by a utility retailer, the VTN provides APIs to allow the retailer to &apos;publish&apos; information it deems appropriate toshare with customers and other interested parties. There is no mechanism by which a VTN (if restricted to implement only its function as a resource server) or its clients may interact with other components of a utility&apos;s systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>VTN clients include utility Business Logic and VENs; therefore a security solution must work for both scenarios.
<ul>
<li>Client requests must be associated with a client role, and roles define what operations on what API objects a given client may perform. For example, a Business Logic client may create an event, but a VEN cannot. Both can read an event, but a VEN can only read events associated with the programs it is entitled to access.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>VENs may be implemented within on-site customer devices such as a water heater, external hardware controllers, or a central device. VENs may also be implemented in servers in the cloud.
<ul>
<li>This implies that certifying devices and provisioning x.509 certs or other PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) as detailed in OpenADR 2.0b is daunting at best, or simply not supportable.</li>
<li>A REST API requires some form of application level credential exchange to authenticate and authorize client requests. Even where PKI may be required, it is not sufficient to address access control of API objects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Devices (OpenADR &apos;resources&apos;) represented by VENs are owned by a utility customer, who has a customer account with the utility.
<ul>
<li>A utility may require that for a customer to participate in a DR program they enroll their account in the program, and may need to register their &apos;resources&apos; or devices into the program.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>VENs must be manually provisioned with a VTN address that has been provided by the utility retailer.
<ul>
<li>This implies that there is no plug-n-play scenario in which a customer owned device simply begins to participate in a conventional demand response program without some manual configuration. Therefore, the device should present a web UI or other interface to a customer. (Much like a home router presents a web app at a known address).</li>
<li>A typical means to acquire a VTN address would be for a customer to login in to their utility account and obtain the address as part of the enrollment and registration flow described in the bullet above.</li>
<li>Methods to automate and standardize this are under consideration by the OpenADR Alliance but separate from the OpenADR 3.0 standard itself. This could be particularly applicable for automated discovery of price servers with only the identity of a retailer or tariff, or completely automated discovery of a price server local to a customer site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Business Logic and VEN clients must be provisioned with client secrets or other credentials prior to accessing a VTN.</li>
<li>A VTN may be configured to allow &apos;unregistered&apos; VENs to access the API. This model is particularly applicable for the subset of programs that are tariffs and so the information involved is freely available.
<ul>
<li>A customer device may be minimally configured, e.g. just a VTN address that includes the retailer and tariff ID, to read price and related events. In this scenario, the VEN may present some sort of generic credential (perhaps an OpenADR token provided at certification) which the VTN accepts for read access to some programs.</li>
<li>Such a VTN may limit such access only to a subset of programs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Client Scenarios</h2>
<p>The choice of security protocol(s) depends in part on what client
scenarios are anticipated.</p>
<p>A protocol that is difficult and error prone for end users to support
represents a security threat in itself; it is anticipated that humans
may be engaged in creating accounts, obtaining credentials and tokens,
and so on. What can be supported by the average customer is less complex
than what IT professionals could support.</p>
<p>OpenADR 2.0b relies on x509 certificates provisioned into the OS of VTNs
and VENs. This is most appropriate for commercial server to server
communications, as acquiring, provisioning, and maintaining such certs
is generally considered overly complex for use in consumer owned
devices. X509 certs may also be useful in scenarios where a consumer
device has factory installed certs.</p>
<p>VEN client platforms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud-based applications managed by IT professionals, e.g. a DER aggregator, product manufacturer, or other cloud-based service provider. Public cloud environments do not lend themselves to device-level authentication as per x.509 as installing and managing such certs is impractical.</li>
<li>Commercial servers on site managed by IT professionals, e.g. a building or energy management system, or even a device as simple as a Wi-Fi access point.</li>
<li>External control device for a single customer device such as a gateway device of some sort. Such environments do not lend themselves to device-level authentication as per x.509 as installing and managing such certs is impractical.</li>
<li>Appliance or other customer device such as a water heater, refrigerator, in-home battery, or EV. These may be provisioned with security certificates or otherwise configured before installation at a customer site, or provisioned remotely by an IT professional.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a VEN may directly control a device, may translate grid
signals into device control signals that it passes on, or may pass along
grid signals with a subsidiary VTN/VEN relationship or via another
in-building protocol (e.g. BacNET or Matter).</p>
<h2>Non-Authenticated Clients</h2>
<p>A VTN may adopt a security position that responds to all incoming
requests and ignore the specified OAuth2 client credential flow and lack
of bearer tokens in requests. This provision allows programs to offer
public information, such as public pricing schedules to any software
client that makes a request. This scenario introduces security risks and
is intended only for program offerings, and associated VTNs that accept
these risks or mitigate them through unspecified means.</p>
<h2>HTTPS/TLS</h2>
<p>VTN should use &apos;HTTP over TLS&apos;, or HTTPS. Transport Layer Security
[TLS] is required to encrypt all messages &apos;on the wire&apos;. Because of
the wide variety of platforms that may host a VEN and the user
experience issues that could inhibit provisioning of client certs in
every scenario, server-side certs are required, but client-side certs
are not.</p>
<p>TLS 1.2 is required. TLS 1.3 or later is optional. As technology
progresses, these requirements may be updated.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the service provider hosting a VTN to
maintain a secure web platform. This includes updating TLS ciphers when
appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="mqttstls" class="unnumbered">11.6. MQTTS/TLS</h2>
<p>MQTT brokers and clients must support MQTT version 5 (or later)</p>
<p>Clients must use MQTT over TLS (MQTTS) to connect to a VTN message
broker.</p>
<h2>API Gateway</h2>
<p>A production VTN might deploy with an API gateway to implement rate
limiting and perhaps other features. Rate limiting blocks requests after
a certain number within a given time period from a given IP address,
thus mitigating Denial of Service attacks.</p>
<h2>OAuth 2.0 client credential flow</h2>
<p>Certified VEN clients must implement the OAuth2 [OAuth] client
credential flow in which an out of band (from the REST interactions)
process provides a clientID and secret to the VEN and associates the VEN
with a role and associated Access Controls in the VTN. At runtime the
VEN trades the clientID/secret for a short-lived token, which the VTN
uses to Authenticate the client, and therefore Authorize access to
certain resources. The VTN uses the token to determine which programs or
tariffs may be accessed by the VEN.</p>
<p>OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow [Oauth2 Client Flow] is designed to
help facilitate Authentication &amp; Authorization for a Machine To Machine
application. While OAuth itself does not specify the format of the
Access Token, the most common format used is a JSON Web Token (JWT
[JWT]) and this is advantageous for use in OpenADR 3.0.</p>
<p>The Authentication / Authorization process is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A client is provided a client ID and secret via an out-of-band process. In the case of a VEN, a utility customer may engage with their energy retailer via web flow or other process to obtain these values, and then provision the VEN with them.</li>
<li>The client makes a call to an Authorization server with a ClientId and ClientSecret.</li>
<li>The client receives a short-lived API access token.</li>
<li>The VEN client then makes a request to VTN API resource with the access token (in header &quot;Authorization: Bearer &lt;token&gt;&quot;)</li>
<li>The VTN verifies the token and returns an Unauthorized response if invalid or expired.</li>
<li>The VTN determines the client role from the API token and applies fine-grained access control. For example, a VEN client not being allowed to create event objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following is a simplified view of the client credential flow for
VENs. This does not include details such as coordinating the
Authentication server with Business Logic web flow to share client IDs
and secrets or illustrate a similar process for Business Logic clients
of VTN. [Client Flow Overview]</p>

<p><strong>Figure 16: OAuth2 client credential flow</strong></p>
<h2>OpenAPI Specification</h2>
<p>OpenADR 3.0 is defined by an OpenAPI (aka swaggerdoc) YAML file. The
OpenAPI platform provides mechanisms to define security objects and use
them to assign scopes to operations [OpenAPI Auth]. In this manner the
specification defines which clients can perform which operations on
which objects. For example, Business logic clients can create events,
but VENs cannot.</p>
<p>Each endpoint operation definition includes a security attribute, with a
child attribute of oAuth2ClientCredentials that specifies what
permissions are required for the operation. For example,</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">  <span class="hljs-attribute">/programs</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="hljs-attribute">\...\
  get</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="hljs-attribute">\...\
  security</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="hljs-bullet">-</span> <span class="hljs-string">oAuth2ClientCredentials: [read_all]</span>

</code></pre>
<p>The &apos;read_all&apos; scope is defined in the oAuth2ClientCredentials
securitySchemes: section of the OpenAPI document, as are other scopes.</p>
<h2>Bearer tokens</h2>
<p>A VTN is responsible for issuing bearer tokens, and it is an
implementation detail what format to use, what features are encoded in
the token, and how the token is used at runtime besides the role-based
operation access control described above.</p>
<p>For example, a token may encode and be used to filter the events a VEN
can read to only those associated with certain programs.</p>
<h2 id="webhooks" class="unnumbered">11.10. Webhooks</h2>
<p>When working with webhooks there are multiple potential security
concerns, such as infiltrating and probing the VTN internal network
(SSRF)<a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery">^2</a>, etc. These can arise on the sender end (the VTN). On the
receiver end (the VEN), the client needs to verify that the data coming
into their webhook endpoint (the endpoint that accepts webhook
notifications) is actually from the correct application, the VTN, and
has not been spoofed/corrupted in transit.</p>
<p>To strengthen the webhooks security, the following requirements are to
be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The VEN client MUST use HTTPS for the webhook callback URL. The VTN MUST validate that an HTTPS schema is used for the callback URL of the webhook subscription that is created and/or updated.</li>
<li>The VTN MUST verify the webhook callback URL is active and belongs to the requestor. To achieve this, the VTN MUST send a GET request to the provided callback URL that includes a challenge, a query string parameter named &apos;echo&apos;, with random generated string value. When the VEN receives this request on the callback URL, it MUST respond with 200 OK response and include the query string parameter value in the body of the response. The VTN MUST verify that the echo parameter value that was sent back is the same as the one that was initially sent. In case when the validation fails, the VTN MUST NOT allow creation of the subscription.</li>
</ul>
<p>11.9.1 Additional guidelines</p>
<p>Following are a few guidelines that can be taken into consideration in
relation with the webhooks in order to ensure even better security and
reliability.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Configure timeouts</em>. The VTN should configure a timeout when making requests to the VEN client as a webhook consumer. The nature of webhooks suggests that they execute relatively quickly, therefore it is recommended that a VTN configure a timeout period between 10 and 30 seconds.</li>
<li><em>Check for private IPs and reserved IPs</em>. The VTN should check if users are creating subscriptions with a webhook callback URL to <code>http://127.0.0.1</code> or attempting to use URLs that resolve to private ranges. As a potential attack vector are domains that resolve to private IPs. For example, an attacker could set up <code>http://foo.com</code>&gt; which resolves to a private IP.</li>
<li><em>Redirects to private IPs</em>. If the VTN HTTP client library follows redirects, the attacker can set up a webhook callback URL endpoint that redirects to a private IP. It is recommended that a VTN does not follow redirects.</li>
<li><em>Sign webhook payloads</em>. A VEN client may verify the source of a VTN request when a VTN signs the webhook payload with a secret key. One way to do this is symmetrically by using HMAC cryptography algorithm. The VTN signs the webhook payloads with a symmetrical secret key and sends the signature in the request header for the VEN client to verify it.</li>
<li><em>List the origin IPs</em>. A VTN may list and communicate out of band the IP origins of the sent requests to VEN clients. This information allows developers to implement IP policies in their VEN clients for additional security.</li>
<li><em>Error handling and backing off</em>. The VTN sends POST requests to VEN clients endpoints but some of them will inevitably fail (DNS issues, incorrect routing, etc.). VTN may retry to some degree, but not constantly and not forever. The general practices for handling this should be the following:
<ul>
<li>Use fixed delay between retries or even exponential backoff to slowly increase the time between retries.</li>
<li>If an endpoint hasn&apos;t been responding for a while, mark it as &quot;broken&quot; and stop sending requests to it.</li>
<li>Once an endpoint is marked as broken, send a notification (e.g., email) to the developer notifying them that the VTN has been unable to reach the endpoint and they need to fix it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Reference Implementation</h1>
<p>The OpenADR Alliance provides an open source Reference Implementation
(RI) [OADR3-RI] which includes a simple implementation of the client
credential flow.</p>
<p>Using constructs available in OpenAPI and the swaggerhub auto-generated
python VTN server, the RI provides an <code>&lt;base_url&gt;/auth/token</code> endpoint
that clients use to exchange pre-allocated clientID and secret
credentials for an access token. The token is included as a bearer token
header in each subsequent API request. The server framework resolves the
token to a set of scopes which are used to enforce access control to
each endpoint operation. These steps are described below:</p>
<h2>Step 1: Trade clientID/clientSecret for access token</h2>
<p>CURL is a command line tool for making http requests. The example here
illustrates an http GET request to obtain an access token. ClientID and
clientSecret are included as headers, per best practice.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-shell"><span class="hljs-meta prompt_">&#x24; </span><span class="language-bash">curl http://localhost:8080/openadr3/OADR-3.0.0/1.0.0/auth/token \
  -H <span class="hljs-string">&apos;clientID: ven_client&apos;</span> -H <span class="hljs-string">&apos;clientSecret: 999&apos;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The RI hardcodes clientIDs and clientSecrets and tokens. On requests to
the auth/token endpoint the endpoint handler (fetch_token()) interprets
the clientID and clientSecret headers in the request and returns one of
&apos;ven_token&apos;, &apos;bl_token&apos;, or &apos;bad_token&apos;.</p>
<p>In a production environment, the entity that grants clientIDs and
clientSecrets populates a service or database with an association
between those credentials and a token and set of scopes, such that Step
3 below can be performed.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Include access token in API requests</h2>
<p>The token obtained from Step 1 is used in a Bearer token header in API
requests, as illustrated below:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-shell"><span class="hljs-meta prompt_">&#x24; </span><span class="language-bash">curl http://localhost:8080/openadr3/OADR-3.0.0/1.0.0/programs \
  -H <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Authorization: Bearer ven_token&quot;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<h2>Step 3: Resolve token to scopes</h2>
<p>A scope is a string associated with an endpoint operation that the
server framework checks to ensure an incoming request is permitted. See
section above titled <strong>OpenAPI Specification</strong> for an example.</p>
<p class="mark">On every API request (except <code>&lt;base_url&gt;/auth/token</code>) the server
framework invokes the authorization_controller.[check_oAuth2ClientCredentials() method to
resolve a token to a set of scopes.]</p>
<p class="mark">[The RI hardcodes the association between tokens and scopes.]</p>
<p class="mark">[In a production environment, the association between tokens and scopes
is dynamically maintained by service or database.]</p>
<h2>Step 4: Enforce Access Control</h2>
<p class="mark">On every API request (except <code>&lt;base_url&gt;/auth/token</code>), after a token as
been resolved to scopes, the server framework invokes the
authorization_controller.[validate_scope_oAuth2ClientCredentials()
method to ensure the request has been granted the required scopes for
the requested operation. If the required scopes have not been granted an
http 403 status code will be returned.]</p>
<p>[^1]: Note that VTNs may provide some endpoints with no access
restrictions for freely available information such as prices for
common tariffs.</p>
