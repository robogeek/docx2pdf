<h2 tabindex="-1">Introduction</h2>
<p>This document describes a number of common user scenarios of OpenADR 3.0, providing examples of program, event, reports, and endpoint usage. These examples are not prescriptive or normative but are provided as illustrations of how one might use the API.</p>
<p>This document has a similar purpose as the OpenADR 2.0b Program Guide [OADR-2.0b-Program_Guide].</p>
<p>See [OADR-3.0.1-Specification]  and [OADR-3.0.1-Definition] for formal specification of the OpenADR platform.</p>
</section>
<section id="design-principles" tabindex="-1">
<h2 tabindex="-1">Design Principles</h2>
<p>OpenADR 3.0 was designed with the following goals and principles in mind.</p>
<section id="business-objectives" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">Business objectives</h3>
<p>Lower barriers to entry for new entrants.</p>
<p>REST is a more common approach for web services today than SOAP-like interfaces as embodied in OpenADR 2.0b. Therefore more programmers are familiar with more tools to work with REST APIs. It is anticipated that OpenADR will be adopted more quickly by more entities with a simple REST definition as an alternative.</p>
<p>Simpler Implementation.</p>
<p>REST interfaces are less verbose than SOAP equivalents and therefore reduce network utilization, memory footprint, and message latency. REST/JSON is easier to develop and debug than SOAP equivalents. This is particularly important for flexible loads that have a modest overall software footprint.</p>
<p>Coexistence with OpenADR 2.0b.</p>
<p>A REST format of OpenADR is significantly different from 2.0b and the formats are incompatible. It is envisioned that new entrants will develop to the REST format and therefore a growing population of 3.0 VTNs and VENs will emerge. Existing 2.0b VENs may add support for 3.0 to interoperate with newer 3.0 VTNs, and existing 2.0b VTNs may add support for REST and therefore support both 2.0b and 3.0 VENs. It is conceivable that real-time translators between the formats will be developed.</p>
</section>
<section id="design-goals" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">Design Goals</h3>
<p>Functional equivalence with 2.0b.</p>
<p>OpenADR 3.0 supports most, if not all, use cases supported by 2.0b and in use today. OpenADR 3.0 drops support for some use cases that are not currently or likely to be used.</p>
<p>Forward Compatibility.</p>
<p>The API will be able to add new functionality without breaking compatibility with existing clients, i.e. VTNs can evolve independently of VENs.</p>
<p>Push.</p>
<p>A pure REST implementation does not support a PUSH model, as it relies only on HTTP requests from a client, which requires clients to poll the API. In order to deliver events to clients in a low latency application, OpenADR 3.0 defines a PUSH model based on webhooks.  OpenADR 3.1 defines an alternate PUSH model based on standard messaging protocols (initially MQTT), in order to simplify the transmission of notification messages from a VTN to VENs behind common Internet firewalls.</p>
<p>Best Practices.</p>
<p>Numerous sources publish REST best practices, and while there is no authoritative guide, [REST_Best_Practice] is a good starting point.</p>

<section id="user-stories" tabindex="-1">
<h2 tabindex="-1">User Stories</h2>
<p>A User Story is a single sentence in the form of &#x201c;As an [actor,] I [want to], [so that]&#x201d;. This makes explicit which entity is doing what action and the value they receive. Typically a User Story represents an action of a human, but many of these interactions are conducted automatically by software agents.</p>
<section id="actors" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">Actors</h3>
<p>Business entity: an electricity provider or other business entity that provides back-end services that support a Business Logic client.</p>
<p>Business Logic (BL): a software client of a VTN that performs operations on behalf of an energy or energy service provider.</p>
<p>VTN: OpenADR3 resource server</p>
<p>VEN Client: a software client of a VTN that performs operations as requested by Business Logic via a VTN.</p>
<p>Customer (not illustrated): a person that performs setup tasks prior to a VEN conducting interactions with a VTN.</p>
<p>Customer Logic (CL): a software entity that embodies the functional logic within a VEN. A VEN is the software that communicates via the OpenADR 3.0 protocol, and the CL is the software, embodied within the VEN or separated via a VEN specific interface, that in turn interfaces with a set of energy resources.</p>
<p>Resource. A device or system that performs operations as informed by program and events obtained by a VEN and provides data for VEN reports.</p>

<section id="scenarios" tabindex="-1">
<h2 tabindex="-1">Scenarios</h2>
<p>The following are a set of scenarios that illustrate common interactions. In the sequence diagrams, a dashed line indicates that time has passed. Solid lines indicate actions that occur close in time.</p>
<section id="high-level-workflow" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">High Level Workflow</h3>
<p>A VEN client generally requires security credentials to access the VTN API, therefore it is presumed that a Business Logic entity provides an onboarding process for VENs to access the API and participate in a DR program. Once the onboarding process is complete, the typical interaction pattern is for BL to create program and event resources in the VTN, and for VENs to subsequently read these resources and then generate reports. Finally, BL reads reports from the VTN. Figure 1 illustrates a typical expected sequence of interactions.</p>
<img src="./images/workflow.png" alt="High level workflow">
<p>Figure 2. High Level Workflow</p>
<p>An exception to this process is for programs that are available to anyone, without a security credential. The most common case for this is ordinary tariffs, in which there is no reason to keep private the prices they include. In this case, the workflow is mostly the same except that there is no initial &#x2018;enroll&#x2019; activity, and generally no use of reports (since the VEN is not known to the VTN). The CL does need to configure the VEN with the URL for the VTN, possibly the identity of the retailer (this may be the same for the entire VTN), and the tariff the customer is on (locational tariffs can be implemented with a simple suffix on the program ID).</p>
</section>
<section id="enrollment-scenarios" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">Enrollment Scenarios</h3>
<p>OpenADR 3.0 assumes an enrollment process has happened prior to interactions of a VEN with a VTN, in order to provision security credentials and otherwise onboard a VEN into a energy provider&#x2019;s set of programs. The OpenADR 3.0 standard does not define how this process is implemented. It is addressed here as background information as every energy provider must develop their own process and mechanisms to support enrollment. Figure 2 illustrates what might be expected from a typical out-of-band, unspecified enrollment flow. Note that &#x2018;register resources&#x2019; and &#x2018;provide resource IDs&#x2019; are optional.</p>

<section id="subscription-scenarios" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">Subscription scenarios</h3>
<section id="6.3.1-subscription-via-rest-and-notification-via-webhook" tabindex="-1">
<h4 tabindex="-1">6.3.1     Subscription via REST and notification via webhook</h4>
<p>In order to support a PUSH model, the API provides a mechanism for a client to register interest in (&#x201c;subscribe to&#x201d;) operations on resources and receive a &#x2018;callback&#x2019;. This pattern is known as a &#x2018;webhook&#x2019;.</p>
<p>A client creates a subscription indicating a callback URL and a list of the operations and resources it is interested in. For example, a VEN client may wish to receive a callback whenever an event is created, or whenever it is created, modified, or deleted. A BL may set a subscription for reports created by VENs to be notified when a new report is created.</p>
<p>Figure 4. Subscription scenario</p>
</section>
<section id="6.3.2-subscription-and-notification-via-messaging-protocol" tabindex="-1">
<h4 tabindex="-1">6.3.2     Subscription and notification via messaging protocol</h4>
<p>As an alternative to webhook based notification, the API provides a mechanism for a client to query for supported message brokers, and if supported, make subsequent queries to obtain the topic names for object operations the client may subscribe to, and subsequently receive messages regarding operations on those objects.&#x200b;&#x200b;</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="program-scenarios" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">Program Scenarios</h3>
<p>A program is a Demand Response offering of an energy provider. In OpenADR 3.0, a tariff is simply a type of program. Metadata about a program is represented by a program object in OpenADR 3.0 (there is no similar construct in 2.0b). Program metadata usually changes infrequently, perhaps once a year or less. Some fields in the program object may be displayed to persons using a VEN via a VEN provided user interface, but this feature is not required.</p>
<p>A program may declare a set of events and report types needed to meet the business objectives of the program. Every event and report is associated with exactly one program. A provider might offer several programs at the same time, such as a dynamic pricing program that executes concurrently with a load shed program. A single customer may be enrolled in multiple programs simultaneously, e.g. a battery program and an EV program.</p>
<p>Prior to creating events, the BL will create a program in the VTN, which VENs can query for. A VEN can also create a subscription for events, and then receive notifications of new events with a webhook. Webhooks support a &#x2018;push&#x2019; model whereby a VEN may register a callback URL with the VTN to receive notifications, or subscription/notification via message protocol provides an alternate mechanism for VENs to receive event notifications. In practice, VENs may find that simple polling, or a &#x2018;pull&#x2019; model is sufficient for receiving prices that are updated on a regular schedule, but utilize subscriptions for alerts or other events with no particular schedule. This observation applies to the other scenarios described below.</p>
<p>Figure 5. Program Scenario</p>
</section>
<section id="event-scenarios" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">Event Scenarios</h3>
<p>The OpenADR framework supports a number of different Demand Response scenarios. A representative sample is documented here to ensure that OpenADR 3.0 fully supports a range of common use cases. For background see [OADR-2.0b-Program_Guide].</p>
<p>Episodic Demand Response: As BL I want to communicate a Demand Response signal to participating VENs. In this scenario, the event communicates a single start and duration pair. VENs are expected to be pre-programmed, according to an associated Program Description, to interpret the signal, manage associated resources, and generate a corresponding set of reports. Examples include Direct Load Control and Load Shed.</p>
<p>Continuous Demand Response. As a VTN I want to communicate Dynamic Pricing signals to participating VENs. In this scenario, an event communicates a set of start and duration pairs with associated price values. A representative example is sending day-ahead variable pricing for each hour of the following day. VENs are expected to interpret the event(s) and to generate a corresponding set of reports. EV (Electric Vehicle), TOU (Time of Use), CPP (Critical Peak Price), and VPP (Variable Peak Price) prices can be readily encoded as can more continuous prices such as hourly or smaller time periods.</p>
<p>BL will create events in the VTN, which VENs can query for, or receive notification of if they have previously registered a subscription (via either the Subscription/webhook or message protocol subscription mechanisms).  With day-ahead prices, they are fixed once announced and the intervals are never duplicated. With more real-time pricing, there may be a 24-hour forecast announced with each hour, but in subsequent hours, future prices may be adjusted as the forecast changes. It is assumed that a final price for each interval is announced before that interval begins.</p>
<p>Figure 6. Event Scenario</p>
</section>
<section id="report-scenarios" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">Report Scenarios</h3>
<p>OpenADR 3.0 defines mechanisms to enable Business Logic clients to request reports via events and VENs to respond with the appropriate reports. A catalogue of enumerated report types and qualifiers specified in [OADR-3.0.1-Definition] define a range of typical reports. This list can be privately extended..</p>
<p>Reports may be requested by events. The data structures for events and reports are as identical as practical. This design allows VENs to determine how and when to send reports, and BL to unambiguously associate data included in reports to event elements. Example reports are:</p>
<p>Hourly prices and usage</p>
<p>An electricity retailer may publish day ahead prices for each hour of a day, and bill customers at those prices according to usage over each hour. In this scenario, it is critical that usage data corresponds exactly to the hourly rates, that is, a VEN reports data for each hour as described in the event intervals.</p>
<p>BL may generate events that specify this behaviour via a reportDescriptor with the appropriate enumerations. A VEN responds with appropriate reports.</p>
<p>Device status</p>
<p>BL requires the ability to poll resources enrolled in a program to determine their operational state. BL can generate an event containing a reportDescriptor that includes enumerations that indicate it requires a near-real time response indicating the state of every resource under control of each VEN. An event can limit the scope of VENs and resources by providing a set of targets.</p>
<p>Load shed</p>
<p>BL generates an event that signals the start/end time of a load shed event, including report requirements via a list of reportDescriptors that may be interpreted by a VEN as a request to respond prior to the start of the event with a report indicating resource load shed capacity, and respond at the end of the event with an indication of amount of shed load for each resource.</p>
<p>In response to report requests in events, VENs will create reports in the VTN, which Business Logic can query for or receive notification of via subscription.</p>
<p>Figure 6. Report Scenario</p>
<p>Figure 7. Report Scenario</p>
</section>
<section id="ven-and-resource-scenarios" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">VEN and Resource Scenarios</h3>
<p>In order to assign VENs and resources to groups for the purposes of targeting, the API provides mechanisms for clients to create VEN objects, and VEN&#x2019;s may include a list of resource objects. Each of these objects contains a list of group labels that can be modified over time.</p>
<p>Figure 8. VEN and Resource Scenario</p>

</section>
<section id="feature-examples" tabindex="-1">
<h2 tabindex="-1">Feature Examples</h2>
<p>The following subsections illustrate some of the features of OpenADR 3.0. This is not exhaustive and other features are illustrated by specific use cases below.</p>
<p>The descriptions here apply to content, and therefore do not imply requirements on a VTN, as a VTN does not operate on content except for schema validation. If the content guidelines provided here are not followed, client behavior may be unpredictable.</p>
<p>The JSON examples provided here represent message payloads a client sends to the VTN or returned by the VTN. POST examples can be used in a request to a VTN.</p>
<section id="event-priority" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">Event Priority</h3>
<p>Event priority can be used if there is the possibility of events overlapping time and they conflict (events can overlap and not conflict e.g. prices and GHG values, or prices and alerts). Lower numbers have a higher priority, and the highest priority is zero. If two events conflict and they have the same priority, the resulting behavior is not specified by OpenADR.</p>
</section>
<section id="object-references" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">Object References</h3>
<p>OpenADR 3.0 objects may make reference to other addressable objects. For example, an event object is required to include a reference to an associated program. An addressable object is one that can be accessed directly via the API and is populated with an objectID by the VTN on creation. Addressable objects are:</p>
<p>program</p>
<p>event</p>
<p>report</p>
<p>subscription</p>
<p>ven</p>
<p>resource</p>
<p>objectID references are explicit references to specific objects in the VTN. The objectID is independent of any user-assigned attribute of the referenced object.</p>
<p>The usage scenario is that when a client wishes to create object A that includes a reference to object B, it will first read object B to find its VTN-provided objectID, and use that objectID to populate a reference attribute of object A.</p>
<p>For example, when creating an event, a BL client would read the associated program object and write its objectID into the event.programID attribute.</p>
<p>Note that direct object references are not the same as object names used in other contexts. For example, a report.resources.clientName represents an application-defined string and is not a direct reference to an existing object on the VTN. In this case, reports may be created without the need to populate ven or ven resource objects on the VTN.</p>
<p>Events and reports are always associated with a program, and reports are always associated with events. These associations are maintained by making direct object reference. For example, an event will contain the object reference of an associated program:</p>
<p>POST minimal program</p>
<p>GET program</p>
<p>POST minimal event</p>
<p>GET event</p>
<p>Figure 9. Program and Event Examples.</p>
<p>A report contains references to both program and event objects:</p>
<p>POST minimal report</p>
<p>GET report</p>
<p>Figure 10. Report Example</p>
</section>
<section id="event-and-interval-timing" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">Event and Interval Timing</h3>
<p>OpenADR 2.0b introduced events and lists of intervals included in events. OpenADR 3.0 maintains these constructs but adapts them to fit the REST model.</p>
<p>Events must include a list of one or more intervals, each of which defines a temporal window, and includes one or more payloads, such as a price value.</p>
<p>Reports are created by VENs in response to report requests made by events, via reportDescriptors, and generally explicitly refer to the intervals within the associated event.</p>
<p>Intervals may be of even duration and contiguous. In this case, a single intervalPeriod can be included in an event object to set the beginning time of the first interval and the fixed duration of all intervals. In such cases, individual intervals do not need to include intervalPeriod representations.</p>
<p>The lifespan of an event is the start time of the first interval plus the sum of all interval durations, adjusted for overlaps or gaps introduced by start times in individual intervals.</p>
<p>An event on the VTN whose intervals have all transpired is effectively expired.</p>
<p>The use of an intervalPeriod at the event level with duration = &#x201c;P9999Y&#x201d; is a special case that denotes that the event&apos;s intervals continue into the future until the event is deleted or modified. This is useful for requesting a continuous stream of reports for example. However, since duration in this case does not indicate the duration of individual intervals, each interval in the event&#x2019;s interval list must include an intervalPeriod definition with the duration field. For example, in the case of a 48 hour rolling forecast, 48 intervals would be defined, each including a definition for intervalPeriod.duration of 1 hour.</p>
<p>The ISO 8601 compliant duration value  &#x201c;P9999Y&#x201d; represents infinity in this specification [OADR-3.0.1-Specification], as &#x2018;agreed to by communicating parties&#x201d; in ISO 8601 parlance. In this notation &#x201c;P&#x201d; represents &#x2018;period&#x2019;, &#x201c;Y&#x201d; represents year.</p>
</section>
<section id="variable-duration-intervals" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">Variable duration intervals</h3>
<p>To create intervals of unequal duration, or to have them overlap or have temporal gaps, each interval can include its own intervalPeriod. If an intervalPeriod is present in the event, it defines default values that are overridden by any intervalPeriods at the interval level.</p>
<p>If an intervalPeriod is not present in the event, then one must be present in every interval.</p>
<p>The example below shows an event with a set of intervals with the same duration, as specified by the intervalPeriod construct in the event, except the second interval which defines its own duration. In this example, a start of &#x201c;0000-00-00&#x201d; indicates the real-time start of the interval is the end of the previous interval. It is present as it is a required field.</p>
<p>POST event</p>
<p>Figure 12. Variable Duration Interval Event</p>
</section>
<section id="report-management" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">Report Management</h3>
<p>An event may include one or more reportDescriptors to request reports from VENs. The reportDescriptor  timing attributes described here work along with Intervals to fully manage reporting behavior.</p>
<p>Intervals in an event are used to specify the timing of reporting, and a report will include intervals matching those in an event. The reportDescriptor timing attributes described here refer to intervals and not timing parameters.</p>
<p>The reportDescriptor timing attributes are:</p>
<p>startInterval</p>
<p>The interval (counted from the first, or zero-th) at which to generate a report.</p>
<p>Default = -1. Indicates end of last interval.</p>
<p>Example: perhaps an event contains 10 intervals but is only interested in report data for the last 5. startInterval = 5.</p>
<p>numIntervals</p>
<p>The number of intervals to include in a report</p>
<p>Default = -1. Indicates include all intervals.</p>
<p>Example: perhaps an event contains 10 intervals but is only interested in report data for 3. numIntervals = 3.</p>
<p>StartInterval and numIntervals together define a &#x2018;window&#x2019; or contiguous subset of intervals.</p>
<p>historical</p>
<p>The &#x201c;direction&#x201d; of intervals included in a report. If true, intervals preceding the startInterval determine reporting periods, if false intervals succeeding the startInterval determine reporting periods e.g. a forecast.</p>
<p>Default: true. Report includes historical information.</p>
<p>Example: an event contains 24 pricing intervals and wants a report that includes all the intervals AFTER the VEN has operated on the last interval. historical = true.</p>
<p>frequency</p>
<p>The number of intervals between each report</p>
<p>Default: -1. Indicates all intervals, e.g. a single report</p>
<p>Example: an event includes 10 intervals and wants 5 reports, one for each set of 2 intervals. frequency = 2.</p>
<p>repeat</p>
<p>Number of times to repeat. -1 indicates repeat indefinitely.</p>
<p>Default: 1 (indicates produce 1 report)</p>
<p>Example. an event contains an empty intervals definition but requests a continuous stream of reports based on default event intervalPeriod. repeat = -1 (repeat forever). See 9.7 Capability Forecast Reporting</p>
<p>The following diagrams provide examples of the reportDescriptor reporting attributes.</p>
<p>Figure 11. reportDescriptor Examples</p>
<p>Several examples are provided in the Use Cases section below to illustrate how reporting can be managed.</p>
</section>
<section id="payloaddescriptors" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">payloadDescriptors</h3>
<p>Events and reports generally contain one or more intervals, each of which may contain one or more payload objects. The payload object is purposely kept simple, just type and values attributes, to avoid duplicating static data across a potentially large series of intervals. The payloadDescriptor provides full context for a payload. For example, the values in payload with type of PRICE are simply numbers, and an accompanying payloadDescriptor supplies the units and currency information necessary to fully interpret the price values.</p>
<p>A payloadDescriptor contains a payloadType attribute which associates it to payloads of the same type within the associated intervals.</p>
<p>Note that events do not have a type. The type of an event is implicit in the type of contents that it contains. For example, an event with prices and GHG values can be thought of as a price event, but in OpenADR 3.0, there is no manifestation of this other than the contents of payloadDescriptors and associated payloads. Similarly, reports contain payloadDescriptors but are not otherwise typed.</p>

<p>This approach is limited to payload lists that would normally contain a single entry so that the data quality payload is unambiguously associated with that payload. For example, if the payload list contained payloads for usage and GHG data, there is currently not a way to describe the data quality of one specifically, or both. In such a case, one could create additional intervals, with identical intervalPeriods, for each payload type, or additional events.</p>

<section id="event-cancellation" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">Event Cancellation</h3>
<p>There is no specific mechanism to alter the status or otherwise cancel an event. An event&#x2019;s start and duration may be set to zero (&#x201c;0000-00-00&#x201d; and &#x201c;PT0S&#x201d; respectively) to make its temporal window be of no duration and at some theoretical time in the past. This mechanism is also used to fire a &#x2018;do-it-now&#x201d; event. Another approach is to simply delete an event.</p>
<p>A client could subscribe to event notification to learn that a previously received event has been deleted and therefore implicitly cancelled.</p>

<section id="dynamic-targeting" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">Dynamic Targeting</h3>
<p>For programs that require VENs or their resources be assigned targeting labels at runtime, the API supports representations of VENs and resources with targetValues as attributes.</p>
<p>VENs and BL may create a ven object, and each ven object may be populated with a list of resource objects. Each of these objects may be created and updated with target values. BL may target programs, events and report requests to these target strings.</p>
<p>A client may create a VEN object by POSTing a VEN representation to &lt;&gt;/vens/</p>
<p>POST ven</p>
<p>Figure 20. Dynamic Targeting Ven</p>
<p>The venName may have been provisioned by BL during an out-of-band process.</p>
<p>To create resources, a VEN may POST to &lt;&gt;/vens/{venID}/resources.</p>
<p>POST resource</p>

<p>A GET of &lt;&gt;/vens/{<a href="http://ven.id">ven.id</a>} would yield:</p>

<p>To manage groups and locations or other targeting criteria, clients can modify the target attributes of VENs or resources via PUT, e.g.</p>

This is not an exhaustive list as the protocol is flexible to accommodate many other uses than described here.</p>
<section id="alert" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">Alert</h3>
<p>An Alert is an asynchronous message that generally occurs between a few times per year to only every few years. They are non-financial (do not themselves indicate a change in the customer&#x2019;s bill) and are most commonly used for some sort of emergency or other anomalous condition. BL generates alerts as it deems fit. As they are asynchronous, they are well suited to subscriptions rather than polling.</p>
<p>An Alert is of a type (e.g. &#x2018;Grid Emergency&#x2019;) suitable for use by devices, and a free text string intended to be shared with any human involved with the customer site. For many alerts, the distribution system may be damaged interrupting power supply, and devices and humans may change their operation in response to this and other impacts of the alerts.</p>

<p>A BL logic entity wishes to provide ad-hoc events to VENs to signal resources of an upcoming Load Shed &#x2018;event&#x2019;. Traditionally, resources have enrolled in an energy retailer&#x2019;s load shed offering and await a signal indicating a temporal window during which to modify energy consumption. Specific examples following this pattern are critical peak prices, direct load control, and simple shed events, as from [OADR-2.0b-Program_Guide].</p>
<section id="critical-peak-pricing-program-(cpp%2C-vpp)" tabindex="-1">
<h4 tabindex="-1">Critical Peak Pricing Program (CPP, VPP)</h4>

<section id="capacity-management" tabindex="-1">
<h3 tabindex="-1">Capacity Management</h3>
<p>Until recently, electric utility practice has been to allow any customer to import or export power at a level up to the line rating of the customer service at any time. This was not burdensome as the times when individual customers imported or exported at anomalously high levels were infrequent and not coordinated. The advent of excess PV export and vehicle charging have both changed that assumption. The options now available are to deny new customer DER connections (PV and EV) for the possibility of worst case scenarios violating limits, reducing customer capacity below their line limits &#x2013; or, introducing digital management of capacity.</p>
<p>How best to manage capacity is still an open question and can be expected to evolve in the coming years, but two mechanisms are included &#x2013; one based on announcing limits and the other based on subscriptions for lower levels and permission-based increases in that level.</p>
<section id="dynamic-operating-envelopes" tabindex="-1">
<h4 tabindex="-1">Dynamic Operating Envelopes</h4>
<p>Dynamic Operating Envelopes (DOE) are an alternative mechanism for managing site capacity limits implemented in some jurisdictions (see DER Management Envelope as per Section 9 title in CSIP-AUS (SA HB 218:2023) SA HB 218:2023 | Standards Australia). They communicate a schedule of available site-level import and/or export capacity, the operating envelope. The duration and interval length of the schedule will vary by application. When a new flexible load, such as an EV or stationary battery, wants to import power, it must restrict its consumption so that it does not contribute to an exceedance of the customer IMPORT_CAPACITY_LIMIT. Conversely for distributed generation, such as rooftop PV, that wants to export power, it must restrict its generation so that it does not contribute to an exceedance of the EXPORT_CAPACITY_LIMIT.</p>
<p>When a VEN connects to a VTN, the VTN will announce the customer&#x2019;s dynamic operating envelope schedule with a payload element of IMPORT_CAPACITY_LIMIT and/or EXPORT_CAPACITY_LIMIT if applicable), in units of kW, with an event interval commonly days-long. A new dynamic operating envelope schedule may be announced at any time, including many times per day.</p>
<p>A common usage is for each event to request a report on site operational parameters such as voltage, site-level active and reactive power demand as shown in the example below.</p>
<p>Post event</p>
<p>Figure 44. Dynamic Operating Envelope with Site Parameters Event</p>
<p>The above example illustrates 2 contiguous 30 minute intervals; additional intervals would cover additional time, e.g 48 30 minute intervals would define limits for an entire day.</p>
<p>Should an extended communications interruption occur and the scheduled IMPORT/EXPORT_CAPACITY_LIMIT enumeration values be exhausted, the VEN will utilise the IMPORT/EXPORT_CAPACITY_SUBSCRIPTION enumeration values as default limits. This would typically be announced from the VTN to the VEN on startup, with an event interval that could be years-long, and can be re-announced as needed with a new interval. Following a grid power outage, the VEN must disregard all existing IMPORT/EXPORT_CAPACITY_LIMIT, revert to the IMPORT/EXPORT_CAPACITY_SUBSCRIPTION and re-poll the VTN to establish if an updated IMPORT/EXPORT_CAPACITY_LIMIT schedule has been published.</p>
</section>
<section id="dynamic-capacity-management" tabindex="-1">
<h4 tabindex="-1">Dynamic Capacity Management</h4>
<p>Dynamic Capacity Management is a mechanism for addressing capacity constraints in the distribution system by creating a permission-based system of limiting customer power capacity. In a basic use case, customers subscribe to a capacity level that they normally never exceed for their &#x2018;traditional&#x2019; end uses. When a new device, such as an EV or stationary battery, wants to import power, it can always do so at the difference between the rate of the import subscription level and the consumption of the balance of the system; to import power at a higher rate, a import reservation is required. Conversely for distributed generation, such as rooftop PV, that wants to export power, it can always generate at the total of the export subscription level and the consumption of the balance of the system; to export power at a higher rate, an export reservation is required. In both cases the coordination is with the customer site as a whole.</p>
<p>When a VEN connects to a VTN, the VTN will announce the customer&#x2019;s subscribed capacity with a payload element of IMPORT_CAPACITY_SUBSCRIPTION (and/or EXPORT_CAPACITY_SUBSCRIPTION if applicable), in units of kW, with an event interval commonly years-long. If this is changed (through a process out of band of OpenADR) then a new subscription level is announced. The subscription should also include a report request that the VEN uses to request reservations.</p>
<p>At any time the customer may submit a request with a report including payload elements of IMPORT_CAPACITY_RESERVATION and IMPORT_CAPACITY_RESERVATION_FEE (and/or EXPORT_CAPACITY_RESERVATION and EXPORT_CAPACITY_RESERVATION_FEE), in units of kW and currency/kW (e.g. &#x24;/kW) respectively; this report can have multiple intervals, each of which generates an independent request. This is the additional capacity requested and the fee the customer is willing to pay. The customer will commonly begin with a fee of zero. The VTN will generate an event based on this to announce the customer&#x2019;s upcoming reservations -- a combination of any past reservations that have not expired and successful new ones. To be a successful request, the requested capacity must be available and if the fee request must be sufficient. If multiple requests are submitted simultaneously, it is possible that some will be successful and some not. If the VEN submits a request with a fee higher than is required, the reservation fee is only the required amount. The upcoming reservations are announced with the IMPORT_CAPACITY_RESERVATION and IMPORT_CAPACITY_RESERVATION_FEE payload elements, similarly announced in units of kW and currency/kW). Finally, at the same time the VTN will send out an announcement of future capacity that can be reserved with the IMPORT_CAPACITY_AVAILABLE and IMPORT_CAPACITY_AVAILABLE_FEE payload elements with the same units. All of these four payload elements have counterparts for export which can be used in combination with or instead of import payloads. The VTN may reject reservations if the timing intervals do not match what the VTN expects. For example, the VTN may expect reservations to be on 15-minute intervals and so reject ones that have start times or durations that don&#x2019;t match this.</p>
<p>All of these are announced as intervals and can have one or many intervals in the sequence. Because the capacity information is customer-specific, this is a program requiring authentication, not a tariff relationship as the underlying energy prices are for the same customer.</p>
<p>The diagram below illustrates an example high-level interaction sequence, with a detailed description following.</p>
<p>The anticipated flow is (only numbered interactions are described):</p>
<p>BL logic sends a capacity subscription event to the VTN that contains subscription information. This event could include a report request for capacity request from VENs. A capacity subscription event includes a payload that contains the import and/or export capacity subscription (in kW) for the subscription.</p>
<p>BL may send a capacity reservation event to the VTN at any time. If the capacity subscription event did not include a capacity request report request, this event is expected to  simply request a capacity request report from VENs.</p>
<p>When a VEN wishes to consume more power than its subscription level, it will send a capacity request report to the VTN. The report includes payloads that indicate the interval(s) over which extra capacity is requested and a powerLevel for each.</p>
<p>If BL reads a capacity request report it may create a new capacity reservation event targeted to the requesting VEN. This event is expected to include payloads that indicate a powerLevel over some set of intervals, thus providing a history of the reservations granted to the VEN. These results indicate to the VEN whether the requested reservation has been granted or not.</p>
<p>BL may also target a capacity available event to a VEN to indicate intervals over which capacity reservations might be requested. Such events include payloads containing powerLevel and price.</p>
<p>A VEN may generate a new capacity reservation request report in response to information gleaned from the previous capacity reservation event and capacity available event.</p>
<p>BL may grant or deny the latest reservation request from a VEN by targeting a capacity reservation event to a VEN..</p>
<p>Example request bodies for the above events and reports are as follows; all of the examples are for import but apply equally to export:</p>
